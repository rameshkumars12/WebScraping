# WebScraping

Web Scraping has many names, such as Web Harvesting, Screen Scraping, and others. It is a method of extracting large quantities of data from websites and storing it at a particular location (a local file in your computer or a database in a table). 

In data science, to do anything, you need to have data at hand. To get that data, youâ€™ll need to research the required sources, and web scraping helps you. Web scraping collects and categorizes all the required data in one accessible location. Researching with a single, convenient location is much more feasible and more comfortable than searching for everything one-by-one.

So I used BeautifulSoup, Request library and Selenium to scrape the data from some commonly known websites and collected some useful datasets.

# Request 

The requests module allows you to send HTTP requests using Python.The HTTP request returns a Response Object with all the response data (content, encoding, status, etc).

### Installinge Requests Module
#### >pip install requests

### Importing Requests Library
#### import requests
#### source = requests.get(url)

# BeautifulSoup

BeautifulSoup is used to parse the HTTP returned response object in a tree like structure so that we can extract required data from the response object easily.

### Installinge BeautifulSoup Module
#### >pip install beautifulsoup4

### Importing BeautifulSoup
#### from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs
#### soup = bs(source.content)
