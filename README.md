# WebScraping

Web Scraping has many names, such as Web Harvesting, Screen Scraping, and others. It is a method of extracting large quantities of data from websites and storing it at a particular location (a local file in your computer or a database in a table). 


In data science, to do anything, you need to have data at hand. To get that data, youâ€™ll need to research the required sources, and web scraping helps you. Web scraping collects and categorizes all the required data in one accessible location. Researching with a single, convenient location is much more feasible and more comfortable than searching for everything one-by-one.

So I used BeautifulSoup, Request library and Selenium to scrape the data from some commonly known websites and collected some useful datasets.
